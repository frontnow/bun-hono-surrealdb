SurrealDB is a [multi-model Database](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/features/multi-model-database) that allows you to store and manage date in relational, document, graph, time-series, vector & search and key-value models in one place. 

Unified by a powerful SQL like query language [SurrealQL](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql), you can query SurrealDB in ways that are familiar to you, but with the power of a modern database. In addition, SurrealDB is designed to be [distributed and scalable](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/introduction/architecture), allowing you to build and scale your applications with ease.

Also providing additional query methods like [GraphQL](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/querying/graphql), [HTTP](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/http) and [RPC](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc), you can also query SurrealDB in your native environments using [SDKs](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/sdks), we support [JavaScript](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/sdk/javascript), [Python](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/sdk/python), [Go](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/sdk/golang), [Rust](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/sdk/rust), [Java](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/sdk/java) and [.NET](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/sdk/dotnet).

Things to remember when working with SurrealDB:

- SurrealDB combines different data models in a single database, allowing you to store and manage date in [relational, document, graph, time-series, vector & search and key-value models in one place](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/features/multi-model-database)
- It supports multiple query languages including [SurrealQL (native)](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql), [RPC](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc), [CBOR](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/cbor) and [HTTP API](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/http)
- Can be [embedded directly in applications](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/embedding) or [run as a standalone service](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/installation/running)
- Provides real-time data synchronization and live queries
- Provides a [REST API](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/http) and [WebSocket](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/websocket) for real-time updates
- Provides a [GraphQL API](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/querying/graphql) for querying data
- Provides a [RPC API](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc) for querying data
- Provides a [CBOR API](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/cbor) for querying data
- Provides a [SurrealQL](mdc:https:/surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql) for querying data
